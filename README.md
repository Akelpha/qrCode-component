### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

I have learned how to use bootstrap with vite, in the beginning it was a little bit difficult for me to see images but after many researchs, i have found the problem.

### Continued development

I must improve my skill in boostrap and do more exercises on css especcially width, height(i alwayss forget how to use it very well).
